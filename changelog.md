# KrazyPlayLayer Changelog
## v1.2.2
- Someone had the bright idea to make levels use a different set of logic when restarting from Practice Mode.
  - Now we all have to suffer the consequences.
## v1.2.1
- Added `Always Freeze Camera at Level Start`.
  - This forces the gameplay camera to act as if you were always on Attempt 1 of a level, as opposed to, say, Attempt 295.
- Added `Disable Level Completion Shake`.
  - So I made a very casual bet with Alphalaneous that went "also im 90% sure i can whip something far less convoluted than this", and now we're here.
  - I'd love to dive deeper into the story, but this isn't the place to do that.
- Refactored `Disable Shake Trigger` because I did it the wrong way the first time.
  - Oops. :P
## v1.2.0
